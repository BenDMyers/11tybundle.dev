## Get your 11ty conference merch bundle

With the 11ty conference coming up, you can now get your conference merch bundle...a t-shirt and stickers. [Check it out](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/merch/). The store is open until April 5th.

## Shaving build time

In this issue, [Chris Burnell](https://chrisburnell.com/) showed us how to shave eleventy build times with the use of memoization, a type of caching. It's a [very worthy read](https://chrisburnell.com/article/memoizing-asset-bundles/). I had done some similar work on this site, which I documented in [this post on my personal site](https://www.bobmonsour.com/posts/slashing-by-caching/). If build times have you down, check these out.

## This blog is now available as a newsletter

I'd been mulling this over for months and finally decided to pull the trigger. You can now get this blog as a newsletter. The content is identical to what you see in the posts here. If you're already reading it via RSS, you're covered. If you'd rather get it by email, [you can sign up here](https://buttondown.email/11tybundle). There's also a sign-up form at the bottom of every page of the site. The only places that I announce the blog posts are via [RSS](https://11tybundle.dev/feed.xml), [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@bobmonsour), and the [Eleventy Discord server](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/discord/). So, if you never want to miss an issue, [sign up for the newsletter](https://buttondown.email/11tybundle). And if you're already full to the brim with email newsletters, don't.

## One more thing...

You may not have noticed, but I removed the "Buy Me a Beer" link at the bottom of these posts. I had 3 reasons: first, after a couple of weeks of traffic to the site, there was nary a beer to be had; second, I'd prefer that people spend their hard-earned dollars on more meaningful things, whether that be [supporting Eleventy through an Open Collective contribution](https://opencollective.com/11ty) or any other philanthropic endeavor of your choosing; and third, I wanted to eliminate any unnecessary javascript.

Until next time...
