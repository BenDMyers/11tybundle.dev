> [Registration is now open for the May 9, 2024 11ty conference](https://conf.11ty.dev/). See that button at the tippy-top of every page of this site? That takes you directly to the registration.

Today there was yet another Eleventy Meetup. The organizers are so good that the videos of each of the talks are already posted on YouTube:

- [Building a meetup community site using Global Data Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_H4DxqAiyY) by [Juha-Matti Santala](https://hamatti.org/)

- [Using Eleventy to Gobble Up Everything I Do Online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_87IF7KGgo) by [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/)

Another event, held later today was an excellent panel discussion titled [What's next for Jamstack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn0kBdwGa78)...that's a link to the YouTube replay.

I wrote a post about some refactoring of some code on this site. It's called [Refactoring by shortcode](https://www.bobmonsour.com/posts/refactoring-by-shortcode/).

There were 2 side effects of my doing that.

1. The post items that you see in places like the category listing pages or these blog posts now vary in height as I no longer limit the descriptions to 100 characters. I think it's helpful to have more info before you decide to click, or not. You'll see evidence in the post items listed below.

2. I used the search here to see how many posts used the word Shortcode in their title. There were 8 of them, so now there is a category dedicated to [Shortcodes](/categories/shortcodes/).

That's all for now...until next time...
