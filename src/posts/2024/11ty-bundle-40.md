**More cowbell! I mean more canary!** Eleventy 3.0.0-alpha.7 is out today. It includes _"the eleventyDataSchema property (function callback, async-friendly) in the data cascade"_ as Zach notes in this [GitHub issue comment](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/879#issuecomment-2062585031).

**J.R.R. Tolkien's 'eleventy'** You may be familiar with the story behind the name Eleventy. Zach recounts it here in this [short clip from a recent conversation with Jenn Schiffer at Glitch](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxg2OPg6ZGEx1Tl-XDLdsEPb2hbYCt4fJE?si=B53qVrAXHUmHqaSr). But did you know that J.R.R. Tolkien probably knew that "eleventy" was an Old English word? That's according to [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/bxqi0r/eleventy_was_an_old_english_word/). And [this Guardian piece](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/02/jrrtolkien.books) to celebrate the author's 111th birthday.

**Transforms in the docs** Transforms can modify a template's output. For example, you can _"use a transform to format/prettify an HTML file with proper whitespace."_ Check out the [Transforms docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/transforms/).

**Dev server 2.0.0** The latest version of the Dev Server bumps the node version requirement from 14 to 18+ (a breaking change), along with bug fixes and some minor improvements. [Check out the release notes](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-dev-server/releases/tag/v2.0.0), and [in the docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/dev-server/).

**eleventy-img plugin v5.0.0-beta.1** The excellent eleventy-img plugin has a new beta release. But I have no idea what's new in it as the [tagged release page](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-img/releases/tag/v5.0.0-beta.1) has no notes.

**Validate your data** Coming soon to Eleventy 3.0.0-alpha.7 is _"the eleventyDataSchema property (function callback, async-friendly) in the data cascade"_ as Zach notes in this [GitHub issue comment](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/879#issuecomment-2062585031).

**Embed everything** Here's _"a [collection of Eleventy plugins](https://github.com/gfscott/eleventy-plugin-embed-everything) that allow you to easily embed common media formats in your Markdown using only their URLs."_

**Two new starters** These came across my radar this week and they appear to be well-documented. If you're looking to get started with Eleventy, these might be worth a look. See them on GitHub at [eleventy-duo](https://github.com/yinkakun/eleventy-duo) by [Yinka Adedire](https://github.com/yinkakun) and [eleventy-alembic-starter](https://github.com/digitalinteraction/eleventy-alembic-starter) by [Rob Anderson](https://github.com/robb-j). Their respective demo pages are [here](https://eleventyduo.netlify.app/) and [here](https://eleventy-alembic.openlab.dev/).

**11ty conference speakers...so far** Zach has started dripping out the [list of speakers](https://conf.11ty.dev/#speakers) for the upcoming 11ty conference ([register here](https://conf.11ty.dev/)).
