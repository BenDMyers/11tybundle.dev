The 11ty Bundle started out as a series of blog posts on [my personal site](https://www.bobmonsour.com/). The first 4 issues of the 11ty Bundle were published there and they have been migrated to this site. This is the first issue to be published here. You can learn more about how the 11ty Bundle came to be [here](/about/).

I hope you find this to be a useful resource to help you get the most out of Eleventy. There are more than 300 blog posts across more than 25 categories written by more than 100 authors.

_Don't miss an issue. Grab the [RSS feed](https://www.11tybundle.dev/feed.xml). Feedback is welcome; drop me a line at bob dot monsour at gmail.com._

In this issue, we highlight stories of Eleventy adopters who have migrated from other static site generators, tools, and platforms.

## Recent releases

## Blog posts from around the web

## Built with Eleventy

This list is a little light this week, but not really...since all of the above blog posts are about migrating to Eleventy, all of them _should_ be sites that are "Built with Eleventy."
