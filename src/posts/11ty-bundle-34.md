Well, we've done it...we've crossed the 1,000 post milestone. We're now standing at {{ bundledata.postCount | formatNumber }} posts. I'm not sure what to do to celebrate...I'm open to suggestions.

In addition to the [open call for talk proposals for the 11ty conference](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdwhO1zfEBvl8mVAJQLWbK0EylD4yPCBpe3Lanz8SvFPI9Xg/viewform), there's now an open call to companies and individuals to sponsor the conference. Send an email to [sponsor@11ty.dev](mailto:sponsor@11ty.dev) to receive a sponsorship prospectus.

As I use search more and more on this site, I have been unearthing things that people are using Eleventy for, even if it's just part of their sites. These are more "site feature" oriented rather than nuts-and-bolts Eleventy how-tos. Recently, I was browsing around and thought that there might just be a handful of posts around how to build an image gallery using Eleventy. And now, for your browsing pleasure, I bring you the latest new category...[image galleries](/categories/image-galleries/).

And just the other day on the Discord server, someone found a bunch of YouTube videos related to WebC. I thought I had a few of them on here, but nooooo. They've been added to the [WebC category](/categories/webc/). You can also find them in the [YouTube category](/categories/youtube/).

That's all for now...until next time...
