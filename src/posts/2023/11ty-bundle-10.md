We've got some breaking news. As Zach Leatherman [posted earlier today](https://www.zachleat.com/web/eleventy-side-project/), as of now, Eleventy will no longer continue with full-time sponsorship. Netlify, where Zach works as a staff engineer, provided a full year of sponsorship that allowed Zach to pursue the project with the intensity that we all witnessed.

All that said, Eleventy will continue to be developed as a side project for Zach.

Quoting from [Zach's post](https://www.zachleat.com/web/eleventy-side-project/):

> Eleventy will continue forward in a reduced (and more focused) capacity. Weâ€™ll have to make some tough prioritization decisions which may include deprecation (or community-ownership?) of some of our official plugins (as always obeying semantic versioning principles). You can help inform these decisions by taking the [Eleventy Community Survey (2023)](https://forms.gle/zFA4Jno1cfT8nt9J8).

I urge everyone reading this to [take the survey](https://forms.gle/zFA4Jno1cfT8nt9J8) and make your voice heard. As you'll see in the survey, there is a request to identify any potential future sponsors for the project. If you know of any, please let Zach know.

There are nearly a dozen new blog posts since the last issue and I haven't gotten around to creating a list of sites for this week due to the recent news from Zach.

Other than that, as for this site, I've added a contact form for anyone who wishes to get in touch with me, linked to in the footer. [UPDATE January 25, 2024:] I have since removed the contact form.
