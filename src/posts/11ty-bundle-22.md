I've got way too many things on my plate right now (some good, some not so much), so I'm going to keep this issue short and sweet.

If you had told me back in March when I started this project that there would be more than 800 blog posts on this site by Thanksgiving, I'd have called you crazy. But here we are. Fortunately, I still enjoy cranking this stuff out and I hope that you are finding the content to be useful in your own Eleventy journey.

One new late addition feature: On the [Firehose page](/firehose/), you can collapse the list of posts by year. And whether collapsed or not, searching within the page using the browser's search feature will search all posts, not just the ones that are visible. I'd been wanting to do this for a while and now it's here.

Enjoy the new nuggets below. I hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving, if you celebrate it. If not, I hope you have a wonderful day.
