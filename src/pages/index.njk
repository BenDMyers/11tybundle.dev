<h2>Breaking News</h2>
<p>As Zach Leatherman <a href="https://www.zachleat.com/web/eleventy-side-project/" target="_blank">posted earlier today</a>, as of now, Eleventy will no longer continue with full-time sponsorship. Netlify, where Zach works as a staff engineer, provided a full year of sponsorship that allowed Zach to pursue the project with the intensity that we all witnessed.

All that said, Eleventy will continue to be developed as a side project for Zach.</p>

<p>Quoting from <a href="https://www.zachleat.com/web/eleventy-side-project/" target="_blank">Zach's post</a>:

<blockquote>Eleventy will continue forward in a reduced (and more focused) capacity. Weâ€™ll have to make some tough prioritization decisions which may include deprecation (or community-ownership?) of some of our official plugins (as always obeying semantic versioning principles). You can help inform these decisions by taking the <a href="https://forms.gle/zFA4Jno1cfT8nt9J8" target="_blank">Eleventy Community Survey (2023)</a>.
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>I urge all Eleventy developers to take <a href="https://forms.gle/zFA4Jno1cfT8nt9J8">the survey</a> and help the Eleventy team make the best decisions for the future of this awesome project.</p>
