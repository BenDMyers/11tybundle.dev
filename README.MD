## This project will be a website that will contain a collection of resources for the Eleventy developer community

I started the project after producing several newsletter-type blog posts on my personal website, [bobmonsour.com](https://bobmonsour.com). I call those blog posts [The 11ty Bundle](https://www.bobmonsour.com/tags/11ty-bundle/). I wanted to create a single place where I could share resources and information about Eleventy.

As of today, April 13, 2023, I had already been working on some of the technical underpinnings for this site as (inaccessible) features on my blog, I felt it was time to make it into its own site.

The initial commit to the site is based on the repo for my personal website. Much will change in the coming weeks and months.
