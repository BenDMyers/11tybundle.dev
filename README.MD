## _A resource for all developers using Eleventy_

I started this project after producing several newsletter-type blog posts on my personal website, [bobmonsour.com](https://www.bobmonsour.com). I called those blog posts [The 11ty Bundle](https://www.bobmonsour.com/tags/11ty-bundle/). I wanted to create a single place where I could share resources and information about Eleventy.

While I had already been working on some of the technical underpinnings for the site as inaccessible features on my personal site, I felt it was time to give it its own home.

As of the launch date, May 1, 2023, you can find more than 300 blog posts across more than 25 [categories](https://www.11tybundle.dev/categories/) written by more than 100 [authors](https://www.11tybundle.dev/authors/).

Included in each Bundle blog post are: (1) releases of official Eleventy repos, (2) a list of just a few of the many sites built with Eleventy and, (3) a list of official and community resources. Some posts will cover specific topics and in others I'll share bits of how I used Eleventy to build site.

I have learned a ton while building this project. I hope you find it useful in your work with Eleventy.
